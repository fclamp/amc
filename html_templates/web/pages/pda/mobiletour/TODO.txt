Interface for barcode/rfid/infrared/bluetooth scanner where 
a barcode number is found and the related object can be queried 

File: reader.php

At the moment the page continually checks the position of the mouse.
This is just for show ..    

There is going to have to be some application which reads the rfid/barcode device port and then 
queries the other related pages based on tag id (or irn)

Also the field is searching "SummaryData", this will have to be replaced to 
search a field where barcode/id's are kept.

The multimedia directory needs read and execute permissions for the streaming. 
So when multimedia is inserted into emu the permissions should be set so that 
php can read each piece of multimedia without running into permission problems .


Multimedia streaming types supported : wma, wmv, asf 
Still Working on: mpg, mpeg, mp3 
Image types supported: bmp, jpg, gif, jpeg

Probably should make the system a bit more portable so that its easier to set up 
for new clients. At the moment you are going to have to change alot of links and 
do alot of mucking around to set up the system for a new client 
(for example you have to make a link in htdocs which points to the multimedia directory).
