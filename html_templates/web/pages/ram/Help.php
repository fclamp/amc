	How to use the different search options
</h2>

The <b><u>Quick search</u></b> is the best place to start if you don't have a specify enquiry. Enter a keyword or words in the search box e.g. viola, violinist, playbill, manuscript, painting, baton, letter, or the name of a composer or performer etc. This search is extensive and can produce a long list of results. You may also wish to refine your search by using one of the other search options. <br /><br />

The <b><u>Detailed search</u></b> is best for specific enquiries. You can search on one or more defined fields from the catalogue such as title, object type, collection, etc. <br /><br />

The <b><u>Advanced search</u></b> is more complex and allows you to enter particular phrases and include or exclude certain words. This is especially useful if your Detailed search still produces a long list of results e.g. composer, Purcell <br /><br />

<b><u>Note other useful search tips:</u></b><br />
When searching for a particular composer, for example, such as Handel if a tilde character (~) is placed in front of your search term the search will look for Handel, Handel's, Handels, Handels' etc. <br /><br />

Also by adding an @ in front of a term a 'sounds like' search will be performed e.g. Smith, Smyth and Smythe.<br /><br />
